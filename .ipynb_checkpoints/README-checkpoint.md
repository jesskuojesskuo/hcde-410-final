HCDE 410 Final Project

The proposal involves analyzing the FAOSTAT dataset to examine the factors contributing to differences in caloric intake between countries. However, limitations such as incomplete data reporting and complex interrelated factors may affect the accuracy of the findings. 

This proposal will be using data from the FAOSTAT website, which can be found here: https://www.fao.org/faostat/en/#data/CS

In addition, more information about the open license can be found here: https://www.fao.org/contact-us/terms/en/. More information about how this source will be used to adhere to guidelines will be written in the Project Plan.
